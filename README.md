### What I learned

Through the completion of this project, we have gained valuable knowledge regarding the organization and structuring of web pages. We have learned how to centrally align a div element within a page, thereby creating a more harmonious and balanced appearance of the content. This is particularly useful when aiming to provide a coherent visual experience to our users.

In addition to this, we have discovered how to modify the appearance of a page based on its width.

Another important aspect we have learned is how to divide a div element into two equal components. This technique enables us to organize and arrange content in a clear and orderly manner, facilitating user access to relevant information. Whether it involves two columns of content or a section divided between an image and text, this ability provides us with flexibility and multiple possibilities in web page design.
